## Programming Language III

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract Class: </b>Understanding the use of abstract classes in Java, a key concept in object-oriented programming.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adapter Pattern: </b>Exploring the Adapter Pattern as documented in the GOF Catalog, a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interfaces: </b>Gaining a deeper understanding of interfaces in Java.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strategy Pattern: </b>Studying the Strategy Pattern as documented in the GOF Catalog, a behavioral design pattern that enables choosing an algorithm based on the encountered entity type.
